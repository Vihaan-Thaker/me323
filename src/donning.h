// Getting the helmet on: it has to slide over the head without the head passing
// through any of it. The test here is a straight slide. If the helmet can lift
// off along one fixed direction, it goes on along the reverse. That is
// sufficient, not necessary (a helmet can also be rolled on), and it is checked
// against the head mesh only: the scanned surface plus its lid.
//
// Lifting straight up fails for the Run_2 scan. The back of the skull curves
// under, and about 10% of the lattice space lies beneath it. Tilting the
// lift-off ~25 degrees toward the back of the head clears nearly all of it.

// Up (+Y) tilted by `tilt_degrees` toward +Z (the face; negative = toward the
// back) and by `side_degrees` toward +X. Unit length.
